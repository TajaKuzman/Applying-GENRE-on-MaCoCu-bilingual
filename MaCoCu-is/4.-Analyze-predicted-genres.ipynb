In the following step, the student and team are searching for matching industrial partners having available adequate industrial robots. In year 2015 offered their cooperation 17 industrial partners. After that student prepares all surrounding hardware, sensors and programs for all applications/robots. At the end of february are oppened registrations for the second group of students. Registrations are meant for any other student (who is not subject of this syllabus), who would at selected time have the prepared application available only for him. Nonregistered students and other younger or older visitors are welcome only for observation. The syllabus for student is in addition to complete preparison of robot application and cooperation with industry also including promotion of event in electronic and printed media, as well three day, full day demonstration in the week of DIR. The DIR student organizer obtain the project experience and special knowledge about the robot applications, the second group of students (who are not subject of this syllabus) is widening their field of expertize and competence in general, industry is always coming back due to good ideas. Student organizer obtains competences in project leadership, definition and solution of problems, coordination with industrial partners, design and advertisement of event, communication to media, professional competences linked robot cell design, construction and programming, the competences of individual and group work, as well as help within the group, competences of working with and presenting work to other colleagues and wider audience during DIR days event. The solved problems were several times used by industrial partners as demonstration applications for fairs. Complete scope of knowledge, how to approach the real industrial problem, to robot cell construction, and to robot programing. Experience of cooperation with industry, event promotion in media, interaction with other students and visitors. DIR meetings are scheduled weekly. They are devoted to past work check and to the planing of future activities. In the next step is contacting the industrial partners, who provide most recent equipment (robots). Particular problems that are under student responsibility are being solved step by step in focus groups. The student aranges also all other equipment and acompaning program solutions. The event is advertised in advance through various media and during the event. The solved problems are demostrated by student and available to other students throughout the 3 day DIR event.

       " 'Alcestis is the heroine of a tragedy with a happy ending, written in 438 BC by the ancient Greek playwright Euripides. Despite its age, the work is still surprisingly relevant and attempts, in a subtle and ambiguous manner, to answer fundamental existential questions about death, loss and the role of women in a male-dominated society. Alcestis sacrifices her own life for her weak husband and voluntarily descends to the underworld in his place in order to save him from death. Dissatisfied with his uninvited guest, the irascible demigod Heracles dismisses her from the house of woe and restores her to life. This version of Alcestis, adapted by Lada Kaštelan for Dubrovnik’s Marin Držić Theatre, plunges deeper into the essence of Euripides’s mysterious messages and sensitively discloses them without proffering simple answers. The play is directed by the internationally acclaimed Slovene director Livija Pandur, the winner of the Slovenian Association of Dramatic Artists’ lifetime achievement award in 2018, who divides her professional life among Slovenia, Germany, Spain and Croatia.',\n",
