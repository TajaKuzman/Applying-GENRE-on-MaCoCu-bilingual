Opis poti Grad Rihemberk je najmogočnejši in eden najstarejših gradov na Primorskem, ki je do danes ohranil starodavno srednjeveško zasnovo. Za svojimi zidovi čuva zgodbe stoletij, ki so oblikovala kraje in ljudi v tem delu Evrope. Grajski kompleks je začel nastajati v davnem 13. stoletju, na mestu še veliko starejšega prazgodovinskega gradišča (leta 1600-700 pr. n. št.). Njegova prva omemba sega v leto 1230 – v povezavi z njegovimi prvotnimi posestniki, gospodi Rihemberškimi, ki so gradu in kraju pod njim dali tudi ime. Poleg izjemnega kulturno-zgodovinskega pomena grad danes izstopa tudi kot pomembno zatočišče več ogroženim vrstam netopirjev – skrivnostnih, a človeku koristnih nočnih živali, ki so opuščene grajske kleti in stolpe izbrali za svoje domovanje. Območje gradu je vključeno med zavarovana območja narave Natura 2000. Gostilna Kobjeglava Restaurant se nahaja v kraškem zavetju in s tem ponuja eleganco, intimnost, kot pa tudi neformalnost in užitek. Gostilna Kobjeglava ima svojo restavracijo v kraju Kobjeglava in kavarno na grajskem dvorišču v Štanjelu. Obiščite Kras za več dni in se prepričajte, kako lep je ta del Slovenije. Kras je skozi čas oblikovala mati narava, ki mu daje veliko naravnih znamenitosti katere kraški ljudje ohranjajo in negujejo dan za dnem... Na Krasu boste spoznali žlebiče, škraplje, griže, kamnite gobe,... Vse te večje in manjše oblike kraškega površja se izoblikujejo iz apnenca. Oblikujejo ga dež, veter, sonce ter ostali pojavi matere narave... Jame pa so bogate z različnimi sigovimi tvorbami, v njih pa najdemo tudi različne skalne oblike in sedimente (predvsem jamske ilovice). Lahko rečemo tudi, da se pestrost kraške pokrajine odraža tudi v ljudeh, ki tu živijo že stoletja.. So prijazni, topli in gostoljubni. Obenem pa so si tu izborili svoj košček zemlje skozi zgodovino časa. In tudi rastlinje na kraški pokrajini...to so barve, ki božajo naše oči.

It therefore decided that the provision of the impugned law is not in compliance with the Constitution insofar as it deals differently with municipal judges for administrative offences in comparison with judges. It therefore decided that the provision of the impugned law is not in compliance with the Constitution insofar as it deals differently with municipal judges for administrative offences in comparison with judges. In connection with a constitutional appeal lodged, whereby the procedure of election of judges for administrative offences was impugned, by decision no. Up-159/96 of 19.7.1996 (Official Gazette RS, no. 39/96), the Constitutional Court adopted the standpoint that judges for administrative offences, also in the transitional period - until the harmonisation of the entire ZP with the Constitution - may not have a different position than that defined in article 8 of the Enabling Statute for the Implementation of the Constitution for judges of the former regular and other courts. In connection with a constitutional appeal lodged, whereby the procedure of election of judges for administrative offences was impugned, by decision no. In connection with a constitutional appeal lodged, whereby the procedure of election of judges for administrative offences was impugned, by decision no. It therefore found that the term of office of judges for administrative offences whose term has already expired should be extended and that it will expire six months after the introduction of new regulations which will arrange the election of judges for administrative offences, and that judges for administrative offences also have the right in the case of the new arrangement to complete their term of office in new judicial organs founded in the sphere of administrative offences. It therefore found that the term of office of judges for administrative offences whose term has already expired should be extended and that it will expire six months after the introduction of new regulations which will arrange the election of judges for administrative offences, and that judges for administrative offences also have the right in the case of the new arrangement to complete their term of office in new judicial organs founded in the sphere of administrative offences. At the same time, it also ex officio commenced a proceeding for assessing the constitutionality of the provisions of ZP and the provisions of the Act on the temporary regulation of the organisation and jurisdictions of municipal judges for administrative offences and municipal public defenders (Official Gazette RS, no. 82/94) which regulated the election of judges for administrative offences. By decision no. By decision no. By decision no. U-I-321/96 of 10.10.1996 (OdlUS V, 133; Official Gazette RS, no. 61/96) the Constitutional Court found that the statutory provisions which regulated the election of judges for administrative offences are in conflict with the Constitution and instructed the National Assembly that it remove the established unconstitutionality by 31 March 1997. It also decided at the same time that, until the removal of the established discordance, procedures for electing judges for administrative offences and judges for administrative offences of the Republican Senate for administrative offences may not be commenced or continued. It also decided at the same time that, until the removal of the established discordance, procedures for electing judges for administrative offences and judges for administrative offences of the Republican Senate for administrative offences may not be commenced or continued. In the reasoning, the Constitutional Court explicitly stated that the provisions on the election of judges for administrative offences, in view of their current jurisdiction (when a prison sentence may be imposed for an administrative offence and when an unpaid fine may be changed into a prison sentence) are in conflict with the provisions of articles 129 and 130 of the Constitution and that in the transitional period, it would be possible in relation to the election of judges for administrative offences to determine the mutatis mutandis use of the provisions of the first part of the Courts Act (Official Gazette RS, no. 19/94 and 45/95 - hereinafter: ZS) and the provisions of the Judicial Services Act (Official Gazette RS, no. 19/94 and 8/96 - hereinafter: ZSS). It stressed in particular that, on the basis of article 130 of the Constitution, the National Assembly may only elect judges on the proposal of the Judicial Council, whose composition is determined in article 131 of the Constitution. It stressed in particular that, on the basis of article 130 of the Constitution, the National Assembly may only elect judges on the proposal of the Judicial Council, whose composition is determined in article 131 of the Constitution.

In the cited decisions, the Constitutional Court decided on the position of judges for administrative offences from the point of view of constitutional provisions. To the question of in which branch of authority it is necessary to classify them in compliance with the Constitution, it had to respect the valid arrangement which gives judges for administrative offences a function which is the same as the judicial function. To the question of in which branch of authority it is necessary to classify them in compliance with the Constitution, it had to respect the valid arrangement which gives judges for administrative offences a function which is the same as the judicial function. For this reason, judges for administrative offences can only have the position of judges, as regulated by articles 129 to 134 of the Constitution. For this reason, judges for administrative offences can only have the position of judges, as regulated by articles 129 to 134 of the Constitution.

As the Constitutional Court has already stressed in the cited provisions, the decisions of the Constitutional Court do not bind the legislator in the new statutory arrangement of the field of administrative offences not to decide on a different systemic arrangement from the valid arrangement to date.

As the Constitutional Court has already stressed in the cited provisions, the decisions of the Constitutional Court do not bind the legislator in the new statutory arrangement of the field of administrative offences not to decide on a different systemic arrangement from the valid arrangement to date. It is only necessary to arrange as soon as possible, in compliance with the Constitution, to regulate the election of judges for administrative offences, above all new judges, since a large number of posts of judges for administrative offences are unoccupied, and the backlog of cases is also constantly increasing. So in order to ensure legal security (article 2 of the Constitution) it is necessary to regulate the election of judges for administrative offences in compliance with the Constitution prior to the new systemic arrangement. In view of the fact that the draft of the new ZP, which had already been prepared for second reading, was withdrawn from the legislative procedure in order to study again the new arrangement from the point of view of administrative- criminal law concepts, it is justifiably to be expected that the transitional period will last some further time. The legislator must ensure in this transitional period that the election of judges for administrative offences will be carried out in compliance with constitutional provisions. In this it is not necessarily bound to the systemic arrangement which was adopted with ZSS, under which the election of judges to a permanent function means that the National Assembly elects judges to a permanent function irrespective of the judicial post they will occupy, and that for a change of judicial post or for promotion to a higher judicial post, re-election is unnecessary. In this it is not necessarily bound to the systemic arrangement which was adopted with ZSS, under which the election of judges to a permanent function means that the National Assembly elects judges to a permanent function irrespective of the judicial post they will occupy, and that for a change of judicial post or for promotion to a higher judicial post, re-election is unnecessary.

Equally, it is not bound to the provisions of ZSS and ZS which give the Judicial Council, in addition to constitutional jurisdictions also others - legislative competencies (e.g., article 28 ZS). Equally, it is not bound to the provisions of ZSS and ZS which give the Judicial Council, in addition to constitutional jurisdictions also others - legislative competencies (e.g., article 28 ZS). In connection with judges for administrative offences, a special organ may be established by law for performing these competencies. In connection with judges for administrative offences, a special organ may be established by law for performing these competencies. On the basis of article 30 ZUstS, the Constitutional Court also carried out an assessment of those provisions of the amending ZP, which are directly connected with the impugned provisions and for which it believed that it is important that the question of election of judges for administrative offences be arranged in compliance with the Constitution.

Under the Constitution, therefore, the Judicial Council is the organ which has jurisdiction to carry out a selection among a number of candidates and to propose candidates for election to the judicial function, as well as to propose the dismissal of a judge. Under the Constitution, therefore, the Judicial Council is the organ which has jurisdiction to carry out a selection among a number of candidates and to propose candidates for election to the judicial function, as well as to propose the dismissal of a judge. Under the Constitution, therefore, the Judicial Council is the organ which has jurisdiction to carry out a selection among a number of candidates and to propose candidates for election to the judicial function, as well as to propose the dismissal of a judge. It follows from the cited constitutional provisions that, in this country, a judge may only be someone who has been elected to a permanent function by the National Assembly on the proposal of the Judicial Council. It follows from the cited constitutional provisions that, in this country, a judge may only be someone who has been elected to a permanent function by the National Assembly on the proposal of the Judicial Council.

It follows from the cited constitutional provisions that, in this country, a judge may only be someone who has been elected to a permanent function by the National Assembly on the proposal of the Judicial Council. In article 131, the Constitution determines the number of members of the Judicial Council and its composition. Judges who permanently perform a judicial function elect from among themselves six members to the Judicial Council. Judges who permanently perform a judicial function elect from among themselves six members to the Judicial Council. In section 3, ZS regulates in more detail the manner of proposing and electing members of the Judicial Council and the duration of their term of office. All judges who on the day of election perform a judicial function and are inscribed in the permanent judicial register have the right to elect members of the Judicial Council, and any judge may be elected a member of the Judicial Council except a judge who has been appointed president of a court. All judges who on the day of election perform a judicial function and are inscribed in the permanent judicial register have the right to elect members of the Judicial Council, and any judge may be elected a member of the Judicial Council except a judge who has been appointed president of a court. Despite the fact that judges for administrative offences, for the reasons already cited, were not included in the election of the Judicial Council to date, this fact is not a constitutional bar to the present Judicial Council also having jurisdiction to propose judges for administrative offences for election. ZP envisages in the impugned provisions the founding of a special organ, a so-called Council of judges for administrative offences, which is intended to have jurisdiction for proposing to the National Assembly candidates for election to the function of judge for administrative offences. The legislator, of course, will have to adjust the manner of election of members of the Judicial Council in view of the new functions of the Judicial Council. ZP envisages in the impugned provisions the founding of a special organ, a so-called Council of judges for administrative offences, which is intended to have jurisdiction for proposing to the National Assembly candidates for election to the function of judge for administrative offences. ZP envisages in the impugned provisions the founding of a special organ, a so-called Council of judges for administrative offences, which is intended to have jurisdiction for proposing to the National Assembly candidates for election to the function of judge for administrative offences. The impugned provisions of articles 258b and 258c ZP (which are in terms of content identical to the provision of article 28 ZS, which determines the competencies of the Judicial Council) also determine the composition of the Council of judges for administrative offences and the election of members and the president of the Council for judges for administrative offences. The impugned provisions of articles 258b and 258c ZP (which are in terms of content identical to the provision of article 28 ZS, which determines the competencies of the Judicial Council) also determine the composition of the Council of judges for administrative offences and the election of members and the president of the Council for judges for administrative offences. The sixth paragraph of article 258h gives the Council of judges for administrative offences the further task of personnel council under ZSS, in the procedure for assessing the work of judges for administrative offences. Bearing in mind the decision reasoned under B. Bearing in mind the decision reasoned under B. The Constitutional Court also annulled those provisions which refer to the Council of judges for administrative offences and give it specific competencies, namely: article 258c, 258č, sixth paragraph of article 258h, the fourth sentence of the third paragraph of article 258h ZP and article 21 of the Act amending and supplementing ZP (hereinafter: Amending ZP). In articles 258f and 258g, ZP regulates the procedure for electing new judges for administrative offences. The Amending ZP does not envisage the formation of a personnel council in the procedure of electing new judges for administrative offences, but gives jurisdictions which the personnel councils under ZSS have to the president of organs which conduct the procedure on administrative offences at first instance, and to the president of the Senate for administrative offences of the Republic of Slovenia (hereinafter: president). The Amending ZP does not envisage the formation of a personnel council in the procedure of electing new judges for administrative offences, but gives jurisdictions which the personnel councils under ZSS have to the president of organs which conduct the procedure on administrative offences at first instance, and to the president of the Senate for administrative offences of the Republic of Slovenia (hereinafter: president). In articles 258f and 258g, ZP regulates the procedure for electing new judges for administrative offences. In articles 258f and 258g, ZP regulates the procedure for electing new judges for administrative offences. The first and second paragraphs of article 258f determine that the ministry with jurisdiction for justice shall call for applications for a free working post of a judge for administrative offences, and shall also conduct the application procedure, and that the ministry shall proceed mutatis mutandis according to the provisions of article 15 ZSS. The first and second paragraphs of article 258f determine that the ministry with jurisdiction for justice shall call for applications for a free working post of a judge for administrative offences, and shall also conduct the application procedure, and that the ministry shall proceed mutatis mutandis according to the provisions of article 15 ZSS. This means that a candidate must be given the opportunity to respond to an opinion or an assessment of his or her suitability, and the president should be bound to specific criteria in giving his opinion. Since the cited provisions do not guarantee to candidates for election to the function of judge for administrative offences accessibility to the function under the same conditions, and thus establish an arrangement which means a violation of the third paragraph of article 49 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court annulled article 258f and 258g in entirety, since the annulment of only the impugned provisions is not possible because of contextual links (article 30 ZUstS). Since the cited provisions do not guarantee to candidates for election to the function of judge for administrative offences accessibility to the function under the same conditions, and thus establish an arrangement which means a violation of the third paragraph of article 49 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court annulled article 258f and 258g in entirety, since the annulment of only the impugned provisions is not possible because of contextual links (article 30 ZUstS).

The impugned provisions determine that the president shall form an opinion in relation to proposals for election, the ranking of candidates in relation to the assessment of suitability for election and argue the reasons for the proposed ranking. On the basis of the second paragraph of article 258g, the president must send this opinion to the minister with jurisdiction for justice, who must form his own opinion on the candidates and, together with all records, submit it to the Council of judges for administrative offences.

On the basis of the second paragraph of article 258g, the president must send this opinion to the minister with jurisdiction for justice, who must form his own opinion on the candidates and, together with all records, submit it to the Council of judges for administrative offences. The Council of judges for administrative offences must in the further procedure for election mutatis mutandis use the provisions of articles 18 to 23 ZSS - provisions which refer to the Judicial Council. On the basis of the second paragraph of article 258f, for candidates who are candidating for the first time, only the provision of article 15 ZSS should be used, and not also the other provisions ZSS which determine the obligatory content of data on the professional qualifications of candidates and criteria for their selection. Such provisions are the third paragraph of article 17 and article 30 ZSS. Such provisions are the third paragraph of article 17 and article 30 ZSS. The president would, under the proposed arrangement, perform the function of a personnel council, but in this he would be bound by no criteria and candidates would also not have the opportunity to provide a response to his opinion on the suitability of a candidate. The described provisions are not in conflict with the Constitution only for reasons cited in the previous point, because they refer to the Council of judges for administrative offences, but they also do not guarantee exercise of constitutional rights under the third paragraph of article 49 of the Constitution, that every working post be accessible to everyone under the same conditions. The described provisions are not in conflict with the Constitution only for reasons cited in the previous point, because they refer to the Council of judges for administrative offences, but they also do not guarantee exercise of constitutional rights under the third paragraph of article 49 of the Constitution, that every working post be accessible to everyone under the same conditions.

The Constitution does not guarantee to candidates for judge the prior right that the Judicial Council propose them for election, but it does guarantee accessibility of functions under the same conditions. Since the cited provisions do not guarantee to candidates for election to the function of judge for administrative offences accessibility to the function under the same conditions, and thus establish an arrangement which means a violation of the third paragraph of article 49 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court annulled article 258f and 258g in entirety, since the annulment of only the impugned provisions is not possible because of contextual links (article 30 ZUstS). It is necessary to guarantee with a transitional arrangement that judges for administrative offences will be acquainted with the opinion or with the assessment of suitability of the candidate and that they will have the opportunity to respond to the opinion or assessment. In connection with this, it is also crucially necessary to prescribe criteria in which a president may support his opinion or assessment, since only in a case in which criteria are determined in advance can the same accessibility to a working post be guaranteed. As the Constitutional Court has already stressed, the legislator is not bound in this to the systemic arrangement in ZSS on a unitary position of all judges with a permanent term of office. As the Constitutional Court has already stressed, the legislator is not bound in this to the systemic arrangement in ZSS on a unitary position of all judges with a permanent term of office. As the Constitutional Court has already stressed, the legislator is not bound in this to the systemic arrangement in ZSS on a unitary position of all judges with a permanent term of office. It is necessary to respect that there is not yet a systemic arrangement of the sphere of administrative offences in compliance with the new Constitution and that a specific statutory solution which arranges only the transitional period should be arranged. The Constitutional Court also draws attention to the valid provisions of the second, third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of article 258h, which refer to the pay of judges for administrative offences, and which were not impugned, but which will have to begin to be implemented, and the legislator will probably replace the fourth sentence of the third paragraph of article 258h annulled by this decision.

U-I- 117/93 does not mean that the pay of judges for administrative offences must be equated with the pay of judges of regular courts, but means that it is necessary to include judges for administrative offences in the system of pay which applies for judges, or to supplement this system with the arrangement of the pay of judges for administrative offences.

The Constitutional Court has only decided with this decision that, in view of the principle of the division of power and the functions which in this transitional period pending harmonisation of the sphere of administrative offences with the Constitution judges for administrative offences perform, it is permissible in no context, thus also in relation to pay, to treat judges for administrative offences as administrative organs or employees in state organs.

Prepoved diskriminacije v enakem obsegu določa tudi prvi odstavek 14. člena Ustave. Iz razlogov, ki jih je Ustavno sodišče že navedlo pri presoji izpodbijane ureditve, tudi stališču, na katerem temeljita izpodbijani sodbi, ni mogoče očitati, da krši pravico pritožnice iz drugega odstavka 14. člena Ustave (glej 15. točko obrazložitve). Pritožnica zatrjuje tudi, da je razlaga 45. člena ZSS arbitrarna. Sodniki, ki so po določenem času ponovno izvoljeni v sodniško funkcijo, in tisti, ki to funkcijo neprekinjeno opravljajo, so v različnem položaju, zato jih lahko zakonodajalec različno obravnava. Načelo varstva zaupanja v pravo posamezniku zagotavlja, da mu država pravnega položaja ne bo arbitrarno poslabšala, to je poslabšala brez razloga, utemeljenega v prevladujočem javnem interesu. Zakon o sodniški službi (ali kateri drug zakon) ne določa (in nikoli ni določal), da morajo biti sodniki, ki jim sodniška funkcija preneha, ob ponovni izvolitvi uvrščeni v isti plačni razred oziroma naziv, ki so ga pridobili z napredovanjem pred prenehanjem sodniške funkcije. Zato o pridobljenih pravicah v smislu 2. člena Ustave ni mogoče govoriti. Zahteva po upoštevanju napredovanj iz prvega mandata ob ponovni izvolitvi v sodniško funkcijo tudi ne izhaja iz Ustave. Ureditev razvrščanja v plačne razrede ob ponovnem imenovanju za sodnika (in na splošno ureditev pravic sodnikov, ki so ponovno izvoljeni) sodi v polje proste presoje zakonodajalca. Izpodbijane določbe Zakona o sodniški službi ne učinkujejo neposredno. Predpostavka za vložitev pobude v takšnih primerih je tudi pogoj izčrpanosti pravnih sredstev po vsebini, kar pomeni, da mora pobudnik trditve o domnevni protiustavnosti ureditve, na podlagi katere je bila sprejeta odločitev v njegovi zadevi, uveljavljati že v postopku pred pristojnimi sodišči. Ker pobudnica očitkov o neskladju izpodbijane ureditve s prepovedjo diskriminacije (na podlagi starosti) ni uveljavljala že v postopku pred rednimi sodišči, čeprav je to možnost imela (tožba, revizija), v materialnem smislu ni izčrpala pravnega sredstva. Pobudnica zato kljub vloženi ustavni pritožbi ne izkazuje pravnega interesa za presojo izpodbijanih določb z vidika prepovedi diskriminacijskega obravnavanja. Iz razlogov, ki jih je Ustavno sodišče navedlo pri presoji izpodbijane ureditve, tudi stališču, na katerem temeljita izpodbijani sodbi, ni mogoče očitati, da krši pravico pritožnice iz drugega odstavka 14. člena Ustave. Oceno arbitrarnega ravnanja bi lahko Ustavno sodišče izreklo le v primeru, če sodišče svoje odločitve ne bi utemeljilo s pravnimi argumenti in bi bilo zato mogoče sklepati, da ni odločalo na podlagi zakona, temveč na podlagi kriterijev, ki pri sojenju ne bi smeli priti v poštev. Tega izpodbijanima sodbama ni mogoče očitati, saj sta razumno in prepričljivo obrazloženi z jezikovno in sistematično razlago zakonov (Zakona o sodniški službi in Zakona o sistemu plač v javnem sektorju). Po prvem odstavku 51. člena Zakona o Ustavnem sodišču je mogoče ustavno pritožbo vložiti šele, ko so izčrpana vsa pravna sredstva. Zahteva po izčrpanju vseh pravnih sredstev, ki izhaja iz navedene določbe, ne pomeni samo formalnega izčrpanja (to je vložitve pravnega sredstva), ampak tudi materialno izčrpanje (to je vsebinsko uveljavljanje kršitev človekovih pravic že v vloženih pravnih sredstvih). Geslo: Pritrdilo je stališču tožene stranke, da je glede na 45. člen ZSS pravilna uvrstitev pritožnice v za to sodniško funkcijo izhodiščni 55. plačni razred, saj gre za uvrstitev v plačni razred ob nastopu sodniške službe po izvolitvi, višji plačni razred pa lahko sodnik pridobi le z napredovanjem. Pritožnica zatrjuje, da je razlaga 45. člena ZSS, po kateri ponovno izvoljeni sodnik kljub predhodno doseženemu napredovanju in položaju ne more biti uvrščen v višji plačni razred od najnižjega plačnega razreda, v katerega je uvrščena funkcija, arbitrarna in v neskladju z načelom enakosti pred zakonom. Navaja, da je njen položaj primerljiv s sodniki, ki neprekinjeno opravljajo sodniško službo, ne pa s tistimi, ki so prvič izvoljeni v sodniško funkcijo. Meni, da gre za pridobljeno pravico do upoštevanja sodniških izkušenj in napredovanj, ki mora uživati zakonsko in ustavnopravno varstvo. Svoje mnenje o pobudi je Ustavnemu sodišču poslala Vlada. Glavni očitek pobudnice je, da je opisana izpodbijana ureditev v neskladju z načelom enakosti pred zakonom (drugi odstavek 14. člena Ustave), ker pri uvrstitvi v plačni razred brez razumnega razloga različno obravnava sodnike, ki so po določenem času ponovno izvoljeni v sodniško funkcijo, in sodnike, ki neprekinjeno opravljajo sodniško funkcijo. Sodnikov, ki jim na lastno željo sodniška funkcija preneha in se nanjo po več letih (lahko tudi desetletjih) vrnejo, v vmesnem obdobju navedene zapovedi in omejitve ne vežejo. Zakonska ureditev pobudnici torej ni priznavala posebnih pravic na podlagi v času prvega mandata doseženih napredovanj, zaradi česar o pridobljenih pravicah v smislu 2. člena Ustave ni mogoče govoriti.[8] Zahteva po upoštevanju napredovanj iz prvega mandata ob ponovni izvolitvi v sodniško funkcijo tudi ne izhaja iz Ustave. Zakon o sodniški službi (Uradni list RS, št. 94/07 – uradno prečiščeno besedilo, 91/09, 33/11, 46/13, 63/13, 69/13 – popr. in 17/15) (ZSS), 1. odst. 44. čl. in 45. čl. Ustavna pritožba zoper sodbo Vrhovnega sodišča št. X Ips 365/2014 z dne 24. 2. 2016 v zvezi s sodbo Upravnega sodišča v Ljubljani št. Po prvem odstavku 51. člena Zakona o Ustavnem sodišču je mogoče ustavno pritožbo vložiti šele, ko so izčrpana vsa pravna sredstva. Državni zbor poudarja, da s prenehanjem sodniške službe sodnik ne ohrani nobenih pravic iz položaja, v katerem je bil, ko je opravljal sodniško službo (z izjemo pravice do predčasne upokojitve, če gre za prenehanje sodniške funkcije iz razloga po 3. ali 5. točki prvega odstavka 74. člena ZSS in če izpolnjuje pogoje za tako upokojitev), zato tudi ni mogoče govoriti o pridobljeni pravici do upoštevanja sodniških izkušenj pri uvrstitvi v plačni razred ob ponovni izvolitvi za sodnika. Pritožnica zatrjuje tudi, da je razlaga 45. člena ZSS arbitrarna. Oceno arbitrarnega ravnanja bi lahko Ustavno sodišče izreklo le v primeru, če sodišče svoje odločitve ne bi utemeljilo s pravnimi argumenti in bi bilo zato mogoče sklepati, da ni odločalo na podlagi zakona, temveč na podlagi kriterijev, ki pri sojenju ne bi smeli priti v poštev.	9587	961	Legal

It establishes minimum rules concerning the definitions of offences and related sanctions in this area. It also introduces measures of protection, support and assistance for victims. It replaces Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA as the cornerstone of the EU countries’ criminal justice response to counter terrorism, and amends parts of Decision 2005/671/JHA on the sharing of information and cooperation concerning terrorist offences. Definition of terrorist offences The directive provides an exhaustive list of serious offences that EU countries must classify as terrorist offences in their national law when they are committed or there is a threat to commit them for a particular terrorist aim. Terrorist aims are described as any of the following: Related offences The list of terrorist offences which EU countries must also punish as criminal offences, even if a terrorist offence was not effectively committed, is extended to cover: offences related to a terrorist group (i.e. directing such a group or knowingly participating in its activities) when committed intentionally, and distributing, whether online or offline, a message with the intention of inciting a terrorist offence, for example by glorifying terrorist acts; providing or receiving training for terrorist purposes, for example, in the making or use of explosives, firearms or hazardous substances; travelling inside, outside or to the EU for purposes of terrorism, for example to participate in the activities of a terrorist group or to carry out a terrorist attack; travelling inside, outside or to the EU for purposes of terrorism, for example to participate in the activities of a terrorist group or to carry out a terrorist attack; organising and facilitating such travel, including logistical or material support, such as ticket purchases or route planning; to introduce penalties and sanctions for physical persons and legal entities liable for the offences, which reflect the seriousness of the offences; to take measures for the prompt removal of and blocking of access to online terrorist content hosted in their territory, and to obtain the removal of such content hosted outside their territory; and to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles, as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty on the European Union when implementing this directive; The directive includes additional clauses concerning a range of services to meet the special needs of victims of terrorism, such as the right to immediate access to professional support services offering medical and psychological support and legal or practical advice. It also strengthens emergency response mechanisms to assist victims of terrorism immediately after a terrorist attack. EU countries must ensure that victims of terrorism who are residents of an EU country other than that where the terrorist offence was committed have access to: It has applied since 20 April 2017. EU countries have to incorporate it into national law by 8 September 2018. The directive was adopted in order to align EU law with international developments, such as the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2178(2014) and the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, and to combat the phenomenon of foreign fighters.

Inštitut za medkulturne študije (IMŠ) Fakultete za humanistične študije Univerze na Primorskem (UP FHŠ) je bil ustanovljen leta 2008 kot raziskovalna skupina fakultete. Njegova raziskovalna področja sovpadajo s področji študijskih programov iz humanistike in družboslovja na UP FHŠ (z večino). Zato je IMŠ multidisciplinaren raziskovalni inštitut, v okviru katerega se izvajajo raziskave in projekti na področju zgodovine, geografije, antropologije in etnologije, jezikoslovja, literarnih ved ter medijev. Poudarek je na preučevanju jadranskega, alpskega in kraškega prostora ter na interdisciplinarnosti.

Each issue of the magazine is the result of cooperation between several arts organizations, practitioners and theorists from across the Balkans. Cooperation and information sharing are the keys to sustainability of the independent arts scene in this region and beyond and we are filling the communication gaps between different stakeholders (be it between performers and their audiences or even between arts organizations in different countries). (editor Zvonimir Dobrović) BCC number 5 is about the current cultural (and socio-economic) landscape in a region whose past may seem prone to glorification, even if we may think we know better. Has the future already come when ideologies that we thought past convince us again of their relevance? Especially since we are all always expecting the future to be slightly better than it ends up being. It was the case twenty years ago,and it will be like that twenty years down the line. To tell us more about it we have interviewed Vladimir Arsenijević, one of this generation’s most celebrated authors and intellectuals, and one of the co-editors of the already cult book Lexicon of YU Mythology and Oliver Frljić, the theater director who seems to have specialized in all things YU. Furthermore, one of our editors, Vanja Nikolić gives us an overview of some of the most noted recent theater productions that dealt with the former Yugoslavia on stages across the region.

Glavni cilj je ponuditi prostor mladim neuveljavljenim kot tudi že uveljavljenim umetnikom, ki se ukvarjajo z raziskovanjem in preizpraševanjem različnih modelov produkcije, ustvarjanja in predstavljanja svojega dela. Vsaka posamezna številka revije je rezultat sodelovanja med različnimi umetniškimi organizacijami, ustvarjalci in teoretiki z Balkana. Sodelovanje in izmenjava informacij sta ključna dejavnika za vzpostavitev trajnosti neodvisne umetniške scene v regiji sami kakor tudi izven nje, zato si prizadevamo preseči komunikacijsko vrzel med različnimi interesnimi skupinami (najsibodi med performerji in njihovim občinstvom pa tudi med umetniškimi organizacijami iz različnih držav). Peta številka revije BCC govori o trenutnem kulturnem (in družbeno-ekonomskem) položaju v regiji, katere preteklost se morda zdi nagnjena k poveličevanju, čeprav se nam zdi, da jo dobro poznamo. Je prihodnost že tu, ko nas ideologije, ki naj bi bile stvar preteklosti, znova prepričujejo v svojo pomembnost? Še posebej, ker vsi vedno pričakujemo, da bo prihodnost vsaj malo boljša, kot se nazadnje izkaže. Tako je bilo pred dvajsetimi leti in tako bo tudi čez dvajset let. Da bi izvedeli več, smo pripravili intervju z Vladimirjem Arsenijevićem, enim najbolj priznanih avtorjev in mislecev generacije in enim od sourednikov danes že kultne knjige Leksikon mitologije nekdanje Jugoslavije, in Oliverjem Frljićem, gledališkim režiserjem, za katerega se zdi, da se je specializiral za vse, kar je jugoslovansko. Poleg tega je Vanja Nikolić, ena naših urednic, pripravila pregled nekaterih najnovejših in najbolj odmevnih gledaliških produkcij, ki so se na odrih po regiji ukvarjale z nekdanjo Jugoslavijo.

The 1KA application is distinctly Web 2.0.-oriented and incorporates the dynamic computer programming language JavaScript, which is used extensively to create the content of all dynamic web pages. JavaScript is widely used in all newer versions of web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera), where it is enabled by default. Nowadays, the use of JavaScript is virtually indispensable, because it enables the correct use of popular services such as Gmail, Facebook, YouTube, etc. With the help of JavaScript you can, for example, open a new window, perform calculations, check the correctness of the entered data, etc. These types of operations would not be possible without the use of JavaScript. Thus, certain functions are not possible in survey completion without JavaScript, such as for example warnings for incomplete answers, verification of entered codes, accuracy of conditions, the classification of responses within the questionnaire, etc. Since survey creation relies on advanced Web 2.0 elements, editing a questionnaire without JavaScript is virtually impossible; this principle applies to other similar tools (e.g. Survey Monkey, Qualtrics, etc.). You are therefore advised not to disable JavaScript. Its use can be enabled in most browsers in the following ways: Problems with functions that rely on JavaScrpit are also caused by outdated web browser (e.g. IE8 and older versions). If your browser is outdated, the 1KA system will notify you of this through a ribbon at the top of the page (based on the function get_browser, which notes the browser, operating system, device...). The problem can thus be resolved by updating or changing your browser.	Zakaj je nujno omogočiti Javascript? Storitev 1KA je izrazito Web 2.0 orientirana, v kar spada tudi objektni skriptni jezik JavaScript, ki se v veliki meri uporablja za kreiranje vsebine vseh dinamičnih spletnih strani. Jezik JavaScript je v vseh novejših verzijah razširjenih brskalnikov (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera) privzeto omogočen. Dandanes je uporaba JavaScripta praktično nujna, saj brez tega jezika skoraj nobena od široko priljubljenih storitev ne deluje pravilno (npr. Gmail, Facebook, YouTube itd.). S pomočjo jezika JavaScript lahko npr. odpiramo nova okna, izvajamo izračune, preverjamo pravilnost vnesenih podatkov itd. Izvajanje teh operacij brez uporabe jezika JavaScript ne bi bilo mogoče. Pri izpolnjevanju anket zato brez jezika JavaScript nekatere funkcionalnosti ne delujejo, npr. trda in mehka opozorila na vprašanja, preverjanje vnesenih kod, delovanje pogojev, razvrščanje odgovorov znotraj vprašalnika itd. Ker se izdelovanje anket še posebej zanaša na napredne Web 2.0 elemente, urejanje vprašalnika brez jezika JavaScript praktično ni mogoče, kar velja tudi za druga podobna orodja (npr. Survey Monkey, Qualtrics itd.). Iz zgoraj navedenih razlogov odsvetujemo izklop jezika JavaScript. V najbolj razširjenih brskalnikih ga lahko omogočite na naslednje načine: Težave z delovanjem funkcij, ki se zanašajo na JavaScript, povzročajo tudi zastareli spletni brskalniki (npr. IE8 in starejši). V primeru zastarele različice brskalnika vas 1KA (na podlagi funkcije get_browser, s katero se ugotavlja brskalnik, operacijski sistem, naprave ...) tam prav tako obvesti s trakom na vrhu strani. Nedelovanje funkcij JavaScript v tem primeru rešite tako, da nadgradite ali zamenjate svoj brskalnik.	265	240	Instruction

The revision should cover the results of the analysis by the Agency under Article 9(4) of the Regulation of the overall effectiveness of the CSM for risk evaluation and assessment and experience with its application as well as further developments in the roles and the responsibilities of the assessment body referred to in Article 6 of that Regulation. The revision should also include the qualification requirements (by developing a recognition/accreditation scheme) for the assessment body according to its role in the CSM, with a view to improving clarity in order to avoid differences in application across the Member States, taking into account the interfaces with existing Union authorisation/certification procedures in the railway sector. If feasible, the revision of Regulation (EC) No 352/2009 should also cover further developments in risk acceptance criteria that could be used to assess the acceptability of a risk during explicit risk estimation and evaluation. The Agency submitted its recommendation on the revision of the CSM to the Commission, supported by an impact assessment report to address the mandate of the Commission. This Regulation is based on that Agency recommendation. In accordance with Directive 2004/49/EC the basic elements for the safety management system should include procedures and methods for carrying out risk evaluation and implementing risk control measures whenever a change in operating conditions or new material imposes new risks on the infrastructure or on operations. That basic element of the safety management system is covered by this Regulation. Article 14a(3) of Directive 2004/49/EC requires entities in charge of maintenance to establish a system of maintenance in order to ensure that the vehicles for which they are in charge of maintenance are in a safe state of running. To manage changes in equipment, procedures, organisation, staffing or interfaces, the entities in charge of maintenance should have in place risk assessment procedures. That requirement for the system of maintenance is also covered by this Regulation. As a consequence of the application of Council Directive 91/440/EEC of 29 July 1991 on the development of the Community’s railways (3) and of Article 9(2) of Directive 2004/49/EC, particular attention should be paid to risk management at the interfaces between the actors which are involved in the application of this Regulation. Article 15 of Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the interoperability of the rail system within the Community (4) requires Member States to take all appropriate steps to ensure that the structural subsystems constituting the rail system may be placed in service only if they are designed, constructed and installed in such a way as to meet the essential requirements concerning them when integrated into the rail system. In particular, the Member States must check the technical compatibility of these subsystems with the railway system into which they are being integrated and the safe integration of these subsystems in accordance with the scope of this Regulation. The absence of a common approach for specifying and demonstrating compliance with safety levels and requirements of the railway system among the Member States has proved to be one of the obstacles to liberalisation of the railway market. Such a common approach should be established through this Regulation. Such a common approach should be established through this Regulation. To facilitate mutual recognition between Member States, the methods used for identifying and managing risks and the methods for demonstrating that the railway system in the territory of the Union conforms to safety requirements should be harmonised among the actors involved in the development and operation of the railway system. As a first step, it is necessary to harmonise the procedures and methods for carrying out risk evaluation and implementing control measures whenever a change in operating conditions or new material imposes new risks on the infrastructure or on operations, as referred to in point (2)(d) of Annex III to Directive 2004/49/EC. If there is no existing notified national rule for defining whether or not a change is significant for the safety in a Member State, the company or organisation in charge of implementing the change (the ‘proposer’) should initially consider the potential impact of the change in question on the safety of the railway system. If the proposed change has an impact on safety, the proposer should assess, by expert judgement, the significance of the change based on a set of criteria that should be set out in this Regulation. This assessment should lead to one of three conclusions. In the first situation the change is not considered to be significant and the proposer should implement the change by applying its own safety method. In the second situation the change is considered to be significant and the proposer should implement the change by applying this Regulation, without the need for a specific intervention of the national safety authority. In the third situation the change is considered to be significant but there are provisions at the level of the European Union which require a specific intervention of the relevant national safety authority, such as a new authorisation for placing in service of a vehicle or a revision/update of the safety certificate of a railway undertaking or a revision/update of the safety authorisation of an infrastructure manager. Whenever the railway system already in use is subject to a change, the significance of the change should also be assessed taking into account all safety-related changes affecting the same part of the system since the entry into force of this Regulation or since the last application of the risk management process set out in this Regulation, whichever is the latest. The purpose is to assess whether or not the totality of such changes amounts to a significant change requiring the full application of the CSM for risk evaluation and assessment. The risk acceptability of a significant change should be evaluated by using one or more of the following risk acceptance principles: the application of codes of practice, a comparison with similar parts of the railway system, or an explicit risk estimation. All principles have been used successfully in a number of railway applications, as well as in other transport modes and other industries. The ‘explicit risk estimation’ principle is frequently used for complex or innovative changes. The proposer should be responsible for the choice of the principle to apply. When a widely recognised code of practice is applied, it should therefore be possible to reduce the impact of applying the CSM, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. In the same way, where there are provisions at the level of the Union which require specific intervention by the national safety authority, that authority should be allowed to act as the independent assessment body in order to reduce double checking, undue costs to the industry and time to market. To report to the Commission on the effectiveness and application of this Regulation, and where applicable to make recommendations to improve it, the Agency should be able to gather relevant information from the various actors involved, including from the national safety authorities, from the certification bodies of entities in charge of maintenance of freight wagons and from other entities in charge of maintenance that do not fall within the scope of Commission Regulation (EU) No 445/2011 of 10 May 2011 on a system of certification of entities in charge of maintenance for freight wagons (5). Accreditation of an assessment body should normally be granted by the national accreditation body which has exclusive competence to assess if the assessment body meets the requirements set by harmonised standards. Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (6) contains detailed provisions on the competence of such national accreditation bodies. Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (6) contains detailed provisions on the competence of such national accreditation bodies. Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (6) contains detailed provisions on the competence of such national accreditation bodies. Where harmonised Union legislation provides for the selection of conformity assessment bodies for its implementation, transparent accreditation, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of those bodies. Where harmonised Union legislation provides for the selection of conformity assessment bodies for its implementation, transparent accreditation, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, should be considered by the national public authorities throughout the Union as the preferred means of demonstrating the technical competence of those bodies. However, national authorities may consider that they possess the appropriate means to carry out this evaluation themselves. In such cases, the Member State should provide the Commission and the other Member States with all the documentary evidence necessary for verification of the competence of the recognition body it selects for implementation of the Union legislation. In order to achieve a similar level of quality and trust as expected through accreditation, the requirements and rules for the evaluation and surveillance of assessment bodies in the case of recognition should be equivalent to those used for accreditation. An independent and competent external or internal individual, organisation or entity, a national safety authority, a notified body or a body designated according to Article 17 of Directive 2008/57/EC could act as an assessment body provided it fulfils the criteria required in Annex II. Recognition of internal assessment bodies in compliance with this Regulation does not require an immediate revision of already delivered safety certificates to railway undertakings, safety authorisations to infrastructure managers and certificates to entities in charge of maintenance. Their revision can be made at the next application for renewal or update of the safety certificate, safety authorisation or certificate of the entity in charge of maintenance. In existing legislation there are no limits in the number of assessment bodies accredited or recognised in each Member State and there are no obligations to have at least one. Where the assessment body is not already designated by existing Union or national legislation, the proposer may appoint any assessment body in the Union or in a third country accredited under equivalent criteria and meeting equivalent requirements to those contained in this regulation. The Member State should be able to use accreditation or recognition or any combination of these two options. Regulation (EC) No 352/2009 has become obsolete and should therefore be replaced by this Regulation.

Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 402/2013 of 30 April 2013 on the common safety method for risk evaluation and assessment and repealing Regulation (EC) No 352/2009 Text with EEA relevance The risk acceptability of the system under assessment shall be evaluated by using one or more of the following risk acceptance principles: Risks resulting from these hazards shall be estimated either quantitatively or qualitatively, taking existing safety measures into account. If hazards arise from failures of technical systems not covered by codes of practice or the use of a reference system, the following risk acceptance criterion shall apply for the design of the technical system: Without prejudice to the procedure specified in Article 8 of Directive 2004/49/EC, a more demanding criterion then the one laid down in point 2.5.4 may be requested, through a notified national safety rule, in order to maintain a national safety level. If a technical system is developed by applying the 10–9 criterion laid down in point 2.5.4, the principle of mutual recognition is applicable in accordance with Article 15(5). Nevertheless, if the proposer can demonstrate that the national safety level in the Member State of application can be maintained with a rate of failure higher than 10–9 per operating hour, this criterion may be used by the proposer in that Member State. The explicit risk estimation and evaluation shall satisfy at least the following requirements: Minor changes in input assumptions or prerequisites shall not result in significantly different requirements. The documentation produced by the proposer under point 5.1 shall at least include:	Ta uredba začne veljati 20. dan po objavi v Uradnem listu Evropskih skupnosti.

Owing to this peculiar characteristics of groundwater flow, the behaviour of karst aquifers is especially dependent on respective hydrological conditions and therefore vulnerable to the effects of various environmental changes. Alterations in precipitation and evapotranspiration regimes can cause direct impact through modified amounts and patterns, as well as occurrence of more frequent and severe hydrological extremes. Long-term effects with a diminution of water stocks and short-term effects with the increasingly frequent occurrence of extreme events (e.g., floods, droughts) have already been observed in karst areas of the Mediterrenean, China, Texas and elsewhere. The effects of extreme events such as ice break, heat waves, droughts and storms may cause forest disturbance and, thus, modification of the vegetation cover, which play an important role in water infiltrating into karst systems. Major parts of the pre-alpine regions in Europ are highly karstified and densely forested. Large-scale disturbances in forests thus indirectly endanger stability of their water balance and springs water quality by decreased evapotranspiration and filtration. Despite the important role of karst water resources for freshwater supply, and for supporting the rich and unique biodiversity of the underground water ecosystem, few studies exist that adequately evaluate the impact of predicted global changes on their quantity and quality. Two research institutes, the Karst Research Institute and the Slovene Forestry Institute, both cutting-edge academic institutions in their fields, will address these issues in the present research proposal. The purpose of the project is to examine the impact of environmental changes (climate change, large-scale disturbances in forests) on karst aquifers and to develop an innovative early-warning system for water quantity and quality and expert recommendations for adapted management of karst water sources that will include guidelines for forest management in water protection zones. In selected narrower areas, quantification of the role of the soil and vegetation cover in infiltration processes and evaluation of selected contaminants transport will be done throughout the profile comprising atmosphere – vegetation – soil – unsaturated – saturated aquifer zones. The processes will be modelled by coupling vegetation and hydrological models and by upscaling from local to entire catchment scale by means of remote sensing data. Various scenarios of vegetation changes will consequently be envisaged and impacts to aquifer recharge mechanisms predicted. The results will represent a new contribution in the field of karst hydrology and a globally unique approach to a topic of great actuality.	Vodonosniki s kraško poroznostjo so edinstveni hidrogeološki sistemi zaradi koncentriranega napajanja in hitre infiltracije vode, visoke prepustnosti in hitrega prenosa skozi kraške kanale na velikih razdaljah. Zaradi tega posebnega značaja toka podzemne vode je obnašanje kraških vodonosnikov še posebej odvisno od trenutnih hidroloških razmer in zato občutljivo na vplive različnih okoljskih sprememb. Spremembe padavinskih režimov in evapotranspiracije predstavljajo neposreden vpliv zaradi sprememb v količinah in vzorcih pojavljanja ter pogostejših in močnejših pojavljanj hidroloških ekstremov. V kraških območjih Sredozemlja, Kitajske, Teksasa in drugod so bili ugotovljeni dolgotrajni učinki z zmanjševanjem vodnih zalog in kratkotrajni učinki z vedno bolj pogostim pojavljanjem ekstremnih dogodkov (poplave, suše). Učinki ekstremnih dogodkov, kot so žled, vročinski valovi, suše in nevihte, lahko povzročijo motnje v gozdovih in s tem spremembo vegetacijskega pokrova, ki igrajo pomembno vlogo pri infiltraciji vode v kraške sisteme. Večji deli predalpskih regij v Evropi so močno zakraseli in gozdnati. Velikopovršinske motnje v gozdovih tako posredno ogrožajo stabilnost njihove vodne bilance, z zmanjšano evapotranspiracijo in filtracijo pa kakovost vode na izvirih. Kljub pomembni vlogi kraških vodnih virov za oskrbo z vodo ter njihovi podpori bogati in edinstveni biotski raznovrstnosti podzemnega vodnega ekosistema obstaja le malo študij, ki ustrezno ocenjujejo vpliv predvidenih globalnih sprememb na količino in kakovost kraških voda. Dve raziskovalni inštituciji, Inštitut za raziskovanje krasa in Gozdarski inštitut Slovenije, obe vrhunski akademski instituciji na svojem področju, bosta v predlagani raziskavi obravnavali ta vprašanja. Namen projekta je preučiti vpliv okoljskih sprememb (podnebne spremembe, velikopovršinske motnje v gozdovih) na kraške vodonosnike ter razviti inovativen sistem zgodnjega opozarjanja o količini in kakovosti vode ter strokovna priporočila za prilagojeno upravljanje kraških vodnih virov, ki bodo vključevale smernice za gospodarjenje z gozdovi na vodovarstvenih območjih. V izbranih ožjih območjih bosta kvantifikacija vloge prsti in vegetacijskega pokrova pri infiltracijskih procesih ter ocena transporta izbranih onesnaževal potekali po celotnem profilu, ki bo vključeval območja atmosfera – vegetacija – prst – nezasičeni – zasičeni del vodonosnika. Procese bomo modelirali s združevanjem vegetacijskih in hidroloških modelov. S pomočjo orodij daljinskega zaznavanja bomo razmere napajanja ugotovljene v lokalnem merilu prenesli na območje celotnega zaledja. Zato bodo predvideni različni scenariji sprememb vegetacije in ocenjeni njihovi vplivi na mehanizme napajanja vodonosnikov. Rezultati bodo novost na področju kraške hidrologije in v svetovnem merilu edinstven pristop k reševanju aktualne teme.	423	373	Information/Explanation
